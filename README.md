Day 24 of Spring Boot: Advanced Spring MVC Security! 

Today’s Spring Boot journey leveled up my Spring Security skills! Here’s what I learned:  

1) Role-Based URL Restrictions: Locked down specific pages to ADMIN/USER roles using `hasRole()`.  

2) Custom 403 Page: Created a friendly "Access Denied" page instead of the default error.  

3) Role-Based UI Content: Showed/hided buttons and sections dynamically with `sec:authorize` in Thymeleaf.
